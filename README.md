# For CNN repository
This repository shows how i studied convolutional neural network.

Link to data for house number:  http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/ 
Here the data in .mat format

Link for the data used in util.py is:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data 

 
To use the codes as it is you should follow the same steps:
1- house number data should be put into a directory named  lg_files
2- Facial Expression Recognition data should be put into a directory named large_files
3- or you can easily change the code to work with directory you want.
